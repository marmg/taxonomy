        for calculating the true score after factoring in the point deduction.
        - D) Only a referee can assess a foul. If the referee does not call the foul,
        judges must not make that assessment on their own and should not factor such into
        their scoring calculations.
        - E) If a foul is committed:
        - i) The referee shall call timeout.
        - ii) The referee shall order the offending contestant to a neutral location.
        - iii) The referee shall check the fouled contestant''s condition and safety.
        - iv) The referee shall then assess the foul to the offending contestant and deduct
        points if the referee deems it appropriate, and notify the commission, the corners,
        the official scorekeeper of his decision on whether the foul was accidental or
        intentional and whether a point is to be taken away.
        - F) If a bottom contestant commits a foul, unless the top contestant is injured,
        the contest will continue and:
        - i) The referee will verbally notify the bottom contestant of the foul.

        commission, the corners, the judges and the official scorekeeper.
        - iii) The referee may terminate a contest based on the severity of a foul. For
        such a flagrant foul, the contestant committing the foul shall lose by disqualification.
        - G) Low Blow Foul:
        - i) A fighter who has been struck with a low blow is allowed up to 5 minutes
        to recover from the foul as long as in the ringside doctor''s opinion the fighter
        may possibly continue on in the contest.
        - ii) If the fighter states that they can continue on before the five minutes
        of time have expired, the referee shall, as soon as practical, restart the fight.
        - iii) If the fighter goes over the 5 minute time allotment, and the fight cannot

        - H) Fighter Fouled by other than low blow:
        - i) If a contest of mixed martial arts is stopped because of an accidental foul,
        the referee shall determine whether the unarmed combatant who has been fouled
        can continue or not. If the unarmed combatant''s chance of winning has not been
        seriously jeopardized as a result of the foul and if the foul did not involve
        a concussive impact to the head of the unarmed combatant who has been fouled,
        the referee may order the contest or exhibition continued after a recuperative
        interval of not more than 5 minutes. Immediately after separating the unarmed
        combatants, the referee shall inform the Commission''s representative of his determination
        that the foul was accidental.
        - ii) If a fighter is fouled by blow that the referee deems illegal, the referee
        should stop the action and call for time. The referee may take the injured fighter
        to the ringside doctor and have the ringside doctor examine the fighter as to
        their ability to continue on in the contest. The ringside doctor has up to 5 minutes
        to make their determination. If the ringside doctor determines that the fighter
        can continue in the contest, the referee shall as soon as practical restart the
        fight. Unlike the low blow foul rule, the fighter does not have up to 5 minutes
        of time to use, at their discretion, and must continue the fight when instructed
        to by the referee.
        - iii) For a foul other than a low blow, if the injured fighter is deemed not
        fit to continue, by the referee, the referee must immediately call a halt to the
        bout. If the fighter is deemed not fit to continue, by the referee, even though
        some of the 5 minute foul time is still remaining, the fighter cannot avail himself
        of the remaining time and the fight must be stopped.
        - iv) If the referee stops the contest and employs the use of the ringside doctor,
        the ringside physician''s examinations shall not exceed 5 minutes. If 5 minutes
        is exceeded, the fight cannot be re-started and the contest must end.
